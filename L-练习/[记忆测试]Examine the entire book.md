[记忆测试]Examine the entire book.

Before you read even a single word of the text, check out the table of contents. But do so deliberately and mindfully. This provides you with a great overview of what’s involved in the topic or class. Knowing even that much in a pinch can be a lifesaver. You’ll also want to peruse any photographs. Keep in mind the adage, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” You’ll be surprised when you’re under the gun what you’ll be able to recall simply by doing this.
