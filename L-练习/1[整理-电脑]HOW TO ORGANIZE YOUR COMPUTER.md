 # COMPUTER
In today’s world, we live on our computers. Therefore keeping your computer organized is just
as important as keeping your place organized.
Here are the rules for organizing your computer:
• Keep a clean desktop (with nothing on it but the recycling bin)
• Keep all your useful icons pinned to your task bar
• Put things in their proper folder (i.e. videos in video folder)
• Organize your bookmarks in nice folders (only store bookmarks that are useful, not articles,
instead clip articles to your Evernote)
• Use Feedly for news aggregation instead of bookmarking every site you like
•	 Keep important fles in Google Drive (Google drive integrates into all modern computers)
•	 Sync your Google Drive to the cloud every month
•	 Organize your computer (making sure you do all the above) every month
•	 Back up your important fles to a portable hard drive every quarter

When it comes to organizing your computer every month, it’s easy. Just take everything you’ve
downloaded that month (be it pictures, videos, books or documents) and either delete it or add
it to its proper folder.

I recommend storing all your important fles in your Google Drive, as opposed to your local
hard drive, since it integrates easily within your PC’s C Drive. I don’t store anything on my local
computer, that way if my computer breaks (which it will one day), everything is backed up to
the cloud. And as an added precaution, I back up all my important fles to a portable hard drive
every quarter.
