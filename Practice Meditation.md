Meditation is an ancient practice that is greatly beneficial to your mind. It helps you clear your head so that you can discard negative thoughts and make room for positive ones. It also helps you think more clearly and make better decisions. 
    There are many different types of meditation you can choose from. Each one has a different set of characteristics, requirements, and benefits. One of the most popular and most effective types is mindfulness meditation. 
    This type of meditation is all about focusing on the present moment without judgment. When you practice mindfulness meditation, you acknowledge any thought that comes to your mind but you do not hold onto it. You neither judge nor entertain it. Once you have recognized its presence, you let it go and resume your meditation session. 
    Mindfulness meditation is about being mindful of your surroundings. You use all your sense organs to notice everything around you. You stay in the present and not think of the past or future. This helps you reduce any guilt you may have had from your past or any anxiety that you have towards your future. 
    You can practice meditation anywhere, as long as it is peaceful and comfortable. The important thing is that you are free from distractions and you can fully concentrate on meditating. It is up to you if you want to meditate outdoors or indoors. You can also meditate solo or with a group. 
    It is ideal to practice mindfulness meditation twice a day â€“ upon waking up in the morning and before going to bed at night. This allows you to clear your mind and get ready for the day, and have a restful sleep. 
    However, avoid meditating during lunch time after you have had a meal. Meditating when you are full can make you drowsy and make it quite difficult for you to digest the food.
